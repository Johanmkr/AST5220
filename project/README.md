# AST5220 - Cosmology II - Numerical project

## The work done in order to calculate the CMB power spectrum. 

## Report

The report can be found [here](https://github.com/Johanmkr/AST5220/blob/main/project/tex/cosmology2_report.pdf).

## Milestone 1 - Background cosmology

In milestone 1 we set up the background cosmology and solve for and isotropic and homogenous universe. 

## Milestone 2

## Code explanation

explain

## Run the code

Navigate to the `code`-folder. 

Comment/uncomment line 52-54 in `main.cpp` in order to disable/enable the supernova-fitting.

Build c++ codes:

    make cmb

Run:

    ./cmb

Clean:

    make clean

Run plots for testing:

    make plot_test

Run plots for analysis:

    make plot_analM1

Clean the plots generated:

    make clean_pdfs



## TODO:
 *  Optimise code
 *  Discuss results more (physical explanations).
 *  Derive Friedmann equations in an appendix.
 *  Write abstract.
 *  Write a proper introduction.

 ## Questions
 * Right unit on the $\mathcal{H}$ plot?
 * Regime shading on all plots?
 * Colours on plots okay?
 * Nomenclature in that style yay/nay?
