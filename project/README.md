# AST5220 - Cosmology II - Numerical project

## The work done in order to calculate the CMB power spectrum. 

## Report

The report can be found [here](https://github.com/Johanmkr/AST5220/blob/main/project/tex/cosmology2_report.pdf).

## Milestone 1 - Background cosmology

In milestone 1 we set up the background cosmology and solve for and isotropic and homogenous universe. 

## Milestone 2
some

## Milestone 3
some

## Milestone 4
some



## Code explanation

explain

## Run the code

Navigate to the `code`-folder. 

Comment/uncomment line 61-63 in `main.cpp` in order to disable/enable the supernova-fitting.

Build c++ codes:

    make cmb

Run:

    ./cmb

Clean:

    make clean

Run plots for testing:

    make plot_test

Run plots for analysis:

    make plot_analM1

Clean the plots generated:

    make clean_pdfs



## TODO:
 *  Optimise code


 ### Milestone1

* Code
    * Use OmegaM and OmegaR_tot

* Report
    * Write Abstract

* Sanity checks
    Sanity check for $\eta$, this should be done properly if time allows. 

* Results
    * Discuss physical interpretation.

* Appendix
    * Check feedback on devilry and fix when time is available (lol)


### Milestone 2
* Derive Saha and Peebles in appendix.



### Milestone 3
*   Finish theory of line of sight integration
*   Write about truncation of the multipole expansion
*   Write a section about what we expect and how to test the different things
*   Write method section, briefly   ENOUGH?
*   Write results, discussion and make comparison between it and the analytical stuff.
*   Update nomenclature 

*   Plot analytical solutions in the different regimes + plot of the horizons $k\eta$ as functions of $x$.
 ## Questions
*   Division between main text and appendix, especially for milestone 3.
