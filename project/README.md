# AST5220 - Cosmology II - Numerical project

## The work done in order to calculate the CMB power spectrum. 

## Report

The report can be found [here](https://github.com/Johanmkr/AST5220/blob/main/project/tex/cosmology2_report.pdf).

## Milestone 1 - Background cosmology

In milestone 1 we set up the background cosmology and solve for and isotropic and homogenous universe. 

## Milestone 2
some

## Milestone 3
some

## Milestone 4
some



## Code explanation

explain

## Run the code

Navigate to the `code`-folder. 

Comment/uncomment line 52-54 in `main.cpp` in order to disable/enable the supernova-fitting.

Build c++ codes:

    make cmb

Run:

    ./cmb

Clean:

    make clean

Run plots for testing:

    make plot_test

Run plots for analysis:

    make plot_analM1

Clean the plots generated:

    make clean_pdfs



## TODO:
 *  Optimise code


 ### Milestone1

* Code
    * Use OmegaM and OmegaR_tot

* Report
    * Write Abstract
    * Make tables with fiducial cosmology and best fit cosmology

* Theory

* Sanity checks
    Sanity check for $\eta$, this should be done properly if time allows. 

* Methods 

* Results
    * Talk more about $\sigma$ intervals.
    * Quote constraints on different parameters.
    * Discuss physical interpretation.

* Appendix
    * Check feedback on devilry and fix when time is available (lol)


### Milestone 2
* Derive Saha and Peebles in appendix.


 ## Questions
 * FIXED -> no use more sensible. Right unit on the $\mathcal{H}$ plot?
 * FIXED -> Include lines insteadRegime shading on all plots?
 * FIXED -> appears so. Colours on plots okay?
 * FIXED -> Yay. Nomenclature in that style yay/nay?
