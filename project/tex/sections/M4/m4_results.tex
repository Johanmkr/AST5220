\subsection{Results}\label{sec:m4:results}
    ~\cref{fig:m4:angular_power_spectrum} shows the angular power spectrum as function of photon multipole $l$. The blue drawn line is the main power spectrum, while the dotted lines are the four constituents of the power spectrum that arise from the source function in ~\cref{eq:m3:theory:source_function}. The red lines are observations taken from ~\cite{Planck2020}, and the turquoise shade shows the theoretical cosmic variance as given in ~\cref{eq:m4:theory:cosmic_variance}. As expected, since we ignore both polarisation and neutrinos there is a discrepancy between the observed values and the theoretical prediction. This is most prominent for larger $l$-s where the observational constraints are low due to high statistical accuracy. In discussing this results, we will focus on the three main parts of the plots, namely the \textit{Sachs-Wolfe plateau} for low $l$-s, the \textit{acoustic oscillations} for intermediate $l$-s and the \textit{diffusion damping} for high $l$-s. Lastly we discuss the matter power spectrum in, where we have obtained the observational data from ~\cite{Chabanier_2019} and ~\cite{Hlozek_2012}.

The dotted lines are the individual effect of the different constituents of the source function. The red error bars are observational constraints.}

    \subsubsection{The Sachs-Wolfe plateau}
        The Sachs-Wolfe plateau is the part of the angular power spectrum that appear fairly flat for low $l$, i.e. large scales, hence it names. These large scale represent modes that had not yet entered the horison at the time of recombination. According to the Sachs-Wolfe term in the source function in ~\cref{eq:m3:theory:source_function}, the major contribution to the power spectrum are the temperature anisotropies present at the last scattering surface. This is the main contributor to the transfer function and thus the power spectrum itself. These effects are described by the photon monopole, and the value of the gravitational perturbation, $\Psi$, whose main effect slowed the photons down through gravitational redshift.\footnote{Plus a small quadrupole correction.} For large scales, that have not yet entered the horison at the time of last scattering, the fluctuation to the gravitational perturbation have not yet been affected by causal physics. As a result, they closely resemble the initial perturbations induced by inflation. 

        Thus, the Sachs-Wolfe plateau may be understood as a tracer of the primordial power spectrum. If we continue to assume this take the form of a Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum parametrised by the amplitdue $A_s$ and spectral index $n_s$ we are able to estimate the former by considering the amplitude of the Sachs-Wolfe plateau, and the latter by its shape. $n_s=1$ would generate a flat primordial power spectrum, whereas $n_s>1$ would give emphasis to small scales and vice versa.
