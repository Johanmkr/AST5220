\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

Throughout this project we have investigated the unperturbed FLRW background and its properties, the epoch of recombination, and perturbation to the FLRW background. All of this enabled us to construct the angular power spectrum of the CMB and the matter power spectrum for the total density contrast; quantities which we were able to compare with actual physical observables. These predictions were quite accurate for large scales, but showing a discrepancy larger than the observational uncertainties for the small scales. This is because we ignore the effect of neutrinos, polarisation and heavier elements when evolving the perturbation equations. We also do not consider the epoch of reionisation. Including all these effect would be a natural next step in improving our model. However, we are able to qualitatively discuss the physics behind most aspects of both power spectrums, having succeeded in our initial aim of producing a pipeline that numerically calculated the CMB power spectrum and matter power spectrum, given some cosmological model.
