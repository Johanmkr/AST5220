\section{Milestone II}\label{sec:m2}

The main goal of this section is to investigate the recombination history of the universe. This can be explained as the point in time when photons decouple from the equilibrium of the opaque, early universe.  When this happens, photons scatter for the last time at the \textit{time of last scattering}, and these photons are what we today observe as the CMB. This period of the history of the universe is thus crucial for understanding the CMB. 

We will start by calculating the free \textit{electron fraction} $X_e$, from which we may find the \textit{optical depth} $\tau$. This again enables us to compute the \textit{visibility function}, $g$, and the \textit{sound horizon}, $s$. The latter will be of great importance later.
