\section{Perturbations}\label{sec:m3}

The aim of this section is to investigate how small fluctuations in the baryon-photon-dark-matter fluid in the early Universe grew into larger structures. This is done by examining the interplay between the fluctuation of these fluids and the subsequent fluctuations of the space-time geometry, originating from tiny quantum fluctuation in the very early Universe. We will model this by perturbing the flat FLRW-metric using the conformal-Newtonian gauge. This will impact how the Boltzmann equations for the different species behave, from which we are able to construct differential equations for key physical observables, and their initial conditions.
