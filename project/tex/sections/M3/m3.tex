\section{Milestone III}\label{sec:m3}

The aim of this section is to investigate how small fluctuations in the baryon-photon-dark-matter fluid in the early grew into larger structures. This is done by examining the interplay between these fluid fluctuations and the subsequent fluctuations of the space-time geometry. We will model this by perturbing the flat FLRW-metric using the conformal-Newtonian gauge. This will impact how the Boltzmann equations for the different species behaves, from which we are able to construct differential equations for key physical observables, and their initial conditions.
