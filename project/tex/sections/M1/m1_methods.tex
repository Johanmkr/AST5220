\subsection{Methods}\label{sec:m1:methods}

\subsubsection{Initial equation}
    We have to consider the time evolution of the density parameters, given some present value, as function of our chosen time parameter, here $x$. The density evolution is implemented as:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:m1:methods:initial:density_evolution}
        \O_n = \expe{-\alpha_nx}\O_{n0}\Hp_\mathrm{rat}^2
    \end{equation}
    where we have defined the ratio $\Hp_\mathrm{rat} \equiv H_0/\Hp$, and the new index $n$ are all the densitis: $n\in\{b, \mathrm{CDM}, \gamma, \nu, \Lambda, k\}$.

    We also implement functions to solve for the luminosity distance (\cref{eq:m1:theory:measures:luminosity_distance}), angular distance (\cref{eq:m1:theory:measures:angular_distance_def}), and the conformal distance (\cref{eq:m1:theory:measures:conformal ditance}).


\subsubsection{ODEs and Splines}
    The differential equations for $\eta$ (\cref{eq:m1:theory:measures:eta_diffeq}) and $t$ (\cref{eq:m1:theory:measures:t_diffeq}) are solved numerically as ordinary differential equations with the Runge-Kutta 4 as advancement method. The equations are solved for $x\in(-20,5)$. As initial condition we would like $\eta(-\infty)$ which is obviously not possible to calculate, so we pick some very early time and use the analytical approximation in the radiation dominated era (\cref{eq:m1:theory:sanity:eta_sanity}), which yield:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:m1:methods:odes:eta_initial}
        \eta(x_0) = \frac{c}{\Hp(x_0)}.
    \end{equation}
    Likewise for $t$, the initial condition is:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:m1:methods:odes:t_initial}
        t(x_0) = \frac{1}{2H(x_0)}.
    \end{equation}
    
    We then proceed by making splines of both $\eta$ and $t$ in order to evaluate accurately for any $x\in(-20,5)$. 


\subsubsection{Supernova data}
    We make predictions of the luminosity distance at different redshifts $z$, according to the discussion in ~\cref{sec:m1:measure_time_space}. These predictions are compared with real supernova observations, acquired by \cite{Betoule_2014}. In order to constrain the possible values of $\O_\mathrm{M}$ and $\O_\Lambda$ we find the $\chi^2$-value between the luminosity distance of the supernovas and our predictions. The $\O$-s are sampled with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo sampling using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The $\chi^2$-values are given by:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:m1:chi2_test_def}
        \chi^2(h, \O_{m0}, \O_{k0}) = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{(d_L(z, \O_{m0}, \O_{k0}) - d_L^\mathrm{obs}(z_i))^2}{\sigma_i^2}.
    \end{equation}
    It is easy to see from ~\cref{eq:m1:chi2_test_def} that if the difference between prediction and observation matches the uncertainties in the observed data, then we have $\chi^2 \simeq N$, which is the best fit we can hope for (since we fit to data which has an intrinsic uncertainty already). If $\chi^2\ll N$, then we \textit{over-fit} the model, while if $\chi^2\gg N$ then we have an increasingly bad fit. In summary, we may analyse the following quantity
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:m1:goodness_of_fit}
        \frac{\chi^2}{N} \begin{cases}
            \ll &1 \quad \mathrm{over-fitting,} \\
            \simeq &1 \quad \mathrm{good\ fit,}\\
            \gg &1 \quad \mathrm{bad\ fit,}
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    in order to determine the goodness of fit.
