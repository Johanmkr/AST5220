\subsection{Methods}\label{sec:m1:methods}

\subsubsection{Initial equation}
    We have to consider the time evolution of the density parameters, given some present value, as function of our chosen time parameter, here $x$. The density evolution is implemented as:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:m1:methods:initial:density_evolution}
        \O_n = \expe{-\alpha_nx}\O_{n0}\Hp_\mathrm{rat}^2
    \end{equation}
    where we have defined the ratio $\Hp_\mathrm{rat} \equiv H_0/\Hp$, and the new index $n$ are all the densitis: $n\in\{b, \mathrm{CDM}, \gamma, \nu, \Lambda, k\}$.

    We also implement functions to solve for the luminosity distance (\cref{eq:m1:theory:measures:luminosity_distance}), angular distance (\cref{eq:m1:theory:measures:angular_distance_def}), and the conformal distance (\cref{eq:m1:theory:measures:conformal ditance}).


\subsubsection{ODEs and Splines}
    The differential equations for $\eta$ (\cref{eq:m1:theory:measures:eta_diffeq}) and $t$ (\cref{eq:m1:theory:measures:t_diffeq}) are solved numerically as ordinary differential equations with the Runge-Kutta 4 as advancement method. The equations are solved for $x\in(-20,5)$. As initial condition we would like $\eta(-\infty)$ which is obviously not possible to calculate, so we pick some very early time and use the analytical approximation in the radiation dominated era (\cref{eq:m1:theory:sanity:eta_sanity}), which yield:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:m1:methods:odes:eta_initial}
        \eta(x_0) = \frac{c}{\Hp(x_0)}.
    \end{equation}
    Likewise for $t$, the initial condition is:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:m1:methods:odes:t_initial}
        t(x_0) = \frac{1}{2H(x_0)}.
    \end{equation}
    
    We then proceed by making splines of both $\eta$ and $t$ in order to evaluate accurately for any $x\in(-20,5)$. 


\subsubsection{Model evaluation}
    We evaluate the model by computing the quantities presented in \cref{sec:m1:theory:sanity} and compare with the analytical solutions in different regimes. This will ensure that the model behave as expected.

    Furthermore, we want the model to somewhat resemble reality, we thus use measures of the luminosity distance of supernovas at different redshifts $z$, acquired by \cite{Betoule_2014}. This data is compared to the prediction made by our model. 

    
    In order to constrain the possible values $\O_\mathrm{M}$ and $\O_\Lambda$ we find the $\chi^2$-error between the luminosity distance of the supernovas and the predictions made by our model. The $\O$-s are sampled with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo sampling using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The $\chi^2$-erros is given by:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:m1:chi2_test_def}
        \chi^2(h, \O_{m0}, \O_{k0}) = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{(d_L(z, \O_{m0}, \O_{k0}) - d_L^\mathrm{obs}(z_i))^2}{\sigma_i^2}.
    \end{equation}
