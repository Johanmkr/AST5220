\abstract{
    The cosmic microwave background radiation can be seen across the entire sky, and can provide great insight into the nature of several cosmological phenomena. It is therefore of interest to investigate this theoretically, which is the main aim of this article. We consider linear perturbation to the FLRW cosmology in conformal Newtonian gauge in order to create a pipeline for predicting the power spectra of matter and anisotropies to the CMB. This is done by first calculating the background cosmology, and recombination epoch, including neutrinos. We then ignore neutrinos, polarisation and reionisation when evolving the perturbation equations in time, in order to solve for the power spectra which can be compared with observations. Ignoring these effects yield a significant discrepancy in the result for small scale modes, but provide enough accuracy for the large scale modes. As a result, we obtaine a pipeline through which we can obtain power spectra for different cosmologies and compare them to data, although the analysis is only done for the $\Lambda$CDM-cosmology using data from ~\cite{Planck2020}.
